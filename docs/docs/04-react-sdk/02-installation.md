# Installation

To use the **Sprinter React SDK** in your project, follow these installation instructions.

## Step 1: Install the React SDK and Sprinter SDK

The React SDK requires the core Sprinter SDK (`@chainsafe/sprinter-sdk`) to function properly. You can install both packages using `yarn` or `npm`.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @chainsafe/sprinter-react @chainsafe/sprinter-sdk
```

## Step 2: Ensure React Version

Make sure your project uses **React** version 18.3.1 or higher, as it’s the minimum version supported by the React SDK.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest
```

## Step 3: Wrap Your App with `SprinterContext`

Once the installation is complete, wrap your app’s component tree with `SprinterContext` to provide access to Sprinter’s functionalities across your React components.

:::note
The `baseUrl` should be changed depending on whether you want to interract with test networks or main networks. E.g for Sepolia or BaseSepolia use `Environment.TESTNET`, otherwise use `Environment.MAINNET`
:::

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { SprinterContext } from "@chainsafe/sprinter-react";
import { Environment } from "@chainsafe/sprinter-sdk";

function App() {
  return (
    <SprinterContext baseUrl={Environment.TESTNET}>
      <YourComponent />
    </SprinterContext>
  );
}
```

By passing the `baseUrl`, you specify which endpoint to use for API calls. If you interract with test networks (e.g Sepolia, BaseSepolia...) use the Testnet url otherwise use the Mainnet one.

### Available URLs:

- **Testnet**: `https://api.test.sprinter.buildwithsygma.com`
- **Mainnet**: `https://api.sprinter.buildwithsygma.com`
