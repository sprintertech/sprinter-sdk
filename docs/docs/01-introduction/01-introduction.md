# Welcome To The Sprinter Docs

Sprinter is a **fast, smooth, interoperable intent execution engine**. Our aim is to make multichain interactions feel like one. In doing so, we enhance cross-chain UX _for all_ as a first-class citizen in both existing and upcoming web3 technologies.

## What's Next

- If you're new to Sprinter, begin with [Quick Start](../02-quick-start.md).
- Explore detailed examples and advanced usage in the [SDK Documentation](../sdk).

Stay tuned for the complete source code.
