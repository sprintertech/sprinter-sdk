# What is Sprinter?

Sprinter combines solving-as-a-service infrastructure with credit-based cross-chain liquidity. It enables solvers to borrow and execute on-chain actions without pre-funded inventory, while giving dApps and protocols access to best-in-class execution routes, powered by the Project Blanc advanced solving technology.

## Sprinterâ€™s Core Products

### Sprinter Stash

A cross-chain credit protocol providing liquidity access to solvers and market makers without requiring collateral. Liquidity providers deposit USDC into the protocol, earning returns through solver fees and passive yield strategies.

### Sprinter Solve

A solving-as-a-service platform that offers a request-for-quote (RFQ) based swap API for our partners. It enables dApps, wallets, and protocols to improve execution quality, optimize pricing, and enhance user experience.
