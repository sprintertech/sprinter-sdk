#

Sprinter envisions a decentralized, open and equitable financial system that provides opportunities for everyone. Our mission is to build the infrastructure that democratizes access to crosschain liquidity and optimizes liquidity flows across DeFi.

# What is Sprinter?

Sprinter combines solving-as-a-service infrastructure with credit-based crosschain liquidity. It enables venues to borrow and execute onchain actions without pre-funded inventory, while giving dApps and protocols access to best-in-class execution routes, powered by the Project Blanc advanced solving technology.

## Sprinter’s Core Products

### [Sprinter Stash](Stash)

Sprinter Stash is a universal credit protocol that powers the next-generation of use cases, from solver credit lines to trading, whilst rewarding LPs with sustainable, risk-managed stablecoin yield.

Stash provides zero-collateral credit, so solvers don’t need capital, users don’t need to touch bridges, and dApps get instant fills.

### [Sprinter Solve](Solve)

A solving-as-a-service platform that offers a request-for-quote (RFQ) based swap API for our partners. It enables dApps, wallets, and protocols to improve execution quality, optimize pricing, and enhance user experience.
