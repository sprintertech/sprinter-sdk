Sprinter provides execution for chain abstracton providers by operating a large cluster of solvers that are designed to:
- ⚖️ simplify cross-chain balance aggregation and transaction management 
- 🔀 automatically provide optimized execution paths by determining the fastest and cheapest paths for a transfer, regardless of layer
- 🥰 provide the ultimate UX buff to users, applications, protocols, and wallets
- ⚙️ be unopinionated about account types (EOAs or smart contract accounts)

## 🏃‍♀️ Fast

- **Extensive Route Search**: Our solvers explore a wide array of routes to access deeper liquidity pools.
- **Execution Guarantee**: Ensures transaction execution through our advanced mechanism.
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Liquidity**: Provides JIT liquidity and capital fronting to facilitate transactions efficiently.

## 🥃 Smooth

- **Flexible Account Compatibility**: Supports both externally owned accounts (EOA) and smart contract wallets.
- **Minimized Slippage**: Quotes are derived from multiple pools across various intent protocols to minimize slippage.
- **One-Click Solutions**: Enables seamless and straightforward one-click solutions for user convenience.

## 🤝 Interoperable

- **Multi-Protocol Integration**: Our solvers integrate with multiple protocols to enhance functionality.
- **Account Type Agnostic**: Operates seamlessly regardless of account type.
- **Wallet Implementation Agnostic**: Functions efficiently with various wallet implementations.
- **Flexible Capital Fronting**: Capable of fronting capital across different networks as needed.

## 💳 Capital Efficient

The Sprinter solver engine creates capital efficiency across the cross-chain transaction flow by bearing equivocation risk for users and intent providers. In effect, this optimizes the transaction supply chain for the user since we create the destination calldata. 

## ↔️ Horizontal Scaling

Just as the explosion of the EVM L2 ecosystem has brought about horizontal scalability for the entire Ethereum ecosystem, Sprinter amplifies this effect by facilitating movement of funds between all chains.
