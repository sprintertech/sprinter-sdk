# Stash points

Your participation now earns Stash points, a new rewards system that tracks your contributions across the Sprinter ecosystem.

# Current Activities

## Track Event 1

- The first event will be The 100M Stash, where you can earn Stash points by depositing USDC into Sprinter Stash and locking your liquidity for a chosen duration.

- Stash LPs receive a 1 points per $1 of USDC staked in the liquidity pools

- More ways to earn will be revealed in the coming weeks, in addition to the leaderboard going live soon - so keep stacking points and we’ll see who’s leading the race.

### Early LPs get a head start

Sprinter Stash rewards liquidity providers with points, and yield that scales based on how long you lock your funds. The longer you commit, the higher your multiplier, starting at 0.4x for a 3-month lock, up to a generous 2.2x for a 12-month commitment.

And for early adopters, there’s an additional reason to act fast: deposits made within the first 48 hours of each milestone unlock a **100% SPRNT bonus** on your USDC deposit, on top of your regular rewards. No extra steps required — just show up early, and your bonus will be automatically applied.

To kick things off, we’re rewarding our earliest Stashers with both **base multipliers** and **bonus points**.

**Base Multipliers**

Lock your liquidity and earn more Stash points based on your commitment:

- **3-Month Lock** → 0.4x Stash points
- **6-Month Lock** → 1.0x Stash points
- **12-Month Lock** → 2.2x Stash points

**Bonus rewards (First 48 Hours)**

Deposit USDC in the first **48 hours** of each milestone and you’ll receive a **100% bonus** on your USDC deposit, in Stash points — no extra steps needed.

### How to Stash

Sprinter Stash gives LPs access to dynamic, multichain rewards - powered by solver activity and protocol incentives.

Here’s how it flows:

1. Visit https://app.sprinter.tech/
2. **Connect your wallet & select a chain**

   Deposit USDC directly into Sprinter Stash.

3. **Choose your Stash lockup**

   You can lock your Stash for 3 months, 6 or 12. (Or you can chose not to lock and just earn the APY).

4. **Stash allocates liquidity across chains**

   Liquidity is algorithmically rebalanced to meet solver demand in real time.

5. **Solvers use credit instantly**

   Solvers borrow on destination chains without collateral to execute trades and arbitrage opportunities cross-chain.

6. **Settlement & rewards**

   Once filled, funds are repaid on the source chain. Profits flow back to LPs as APY, solver and strategy fees.

You earn from:

- **Solver fees**
- **Strategy fees**
- **Multi-dimentional Passive yield**
- **Stash points**
- **Rewards** (post TGE)
